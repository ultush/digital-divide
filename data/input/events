C'est une histoire traditionnelle de la panthère et le singe qui se rencontrent dans la forêt lorsque la panthère a besoin d'aide. Cette histoire suit un chasseur dans la forêt dans sa quête pour ramener de la viande à la maison pour sa famille. Il pose un piège puis s'en va. Vient ensuite la panthère qui tombe dans le piège. Il appelle à l'aide. De nombreux animaux passent, mais ils ont trop peur de s'approcher. Enfin, un singe arrive et est intrigué par une promesse de la panthère. Le singe propose de l'aide, mais la panthère essaie de le manger. Un lapin qui passe trouve un moyen de l'aider, et la panthère retourne au piège.  La morale de cette histoire est que les auditeurs comprennent l'importance de tenir ses promesses, et il n'est jamais bon de rembourser le bien par le mal.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNjacko Backo est un percussionniste, chanteur, conteur, chorégraphe, auteur-compositeur qui joue pour les enfants et les adultes depuis son enfance au Cameroun. Il a une vie de pratique à capturer la subtilité de la danse et de la narration avec sa musique - une partie essentielle des arts du spectacle africain. Ses programmes pour enfants et adolescents s'inspirent des parallèles et des différences entre la vie de famille canadienne et africaine et atténuent sa passion pour la langue française.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e***\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eStorytelling by Njacko Backo. This story follows a hunter into the forest on his quest to bring home some meat for his family. He sets a trap and then leaves. Along comes the panther who falls into the trap and cant escape. He cries out for help. Many animals pass by but they are too afraid to come close, even though the panther promises them his friendship. Finally, a monkey arrives and is intrigued by this promise from the panther in exchange for help. The monkey offers help, but then the panther proves untrustworthy and tries to eat the monkey. A passing rabbit finds a way to help out the struggling monkey, and the panther falls back into the hunters trap. The moral of this story is for listeners to understand the importance of keeping our promises, and it is never a good thing to repay goodness with bad.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNjacko Backo is a percussionist, singer, storyteller, choreographer, songwriter and composer who has been performing for children and adults since his childhood in Cameroon. He has a lifetime of practice in capturing the subtlety of dance and storytelling with his music  an essential part of the African performing arts. His programs for children and youth draw on parallels and differences between Canadian and African family life while introducing a passion for the French language.","location":null,"library":"All Branches","link":"http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Em=1\u0026Entt=RDMEVT447941\u0026R=EVT447941","id":"447941","recordtype":"0","RCID":"0","date1":"2020/10/27","date2":"202010271100Ça sonne!

Reconnue pour son talent et admirée pour son tempérament par les artistes contemporains modernes, l'histoire l'a pourtant trop longtemps oubliée, la réduisant à n'être que la belle-soeur du peintre Édouard Manet et la reléguant au rôle de satellite dans le groupe impressionniste. Il a fallu attendre les années 1960 pour que s'établisse un mouvement de réhabilitation de son oeuvre. Aujourd'hui de plus en plus reconnue comme l'un des maîtres de l'Impressionnisme et comme l'un de ses membres clés, Berthe Morisot reste une figure beaucoup moins connue et étudiée que les très célèbres Monet et Renoir.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSes oeuvres, bien moins nombreuses que celles d'autres peintres impressionnistes, notamment parce qu'elle a détruit toutes ses toiles de jeunesse, révèlent une évolution constante à la recherche de son propre style impressionniste. Comme les autres peintres avant-gardistes, elle a dû affronter des critiques acerbes à l'encontre de la modernité de son travail, mais elle était d'autant plus critiquée qu'elle était une femme-peintre dans un groupe à l'écrasante majorité d'hommes, une situation exceptionnelle pour l'époque.
