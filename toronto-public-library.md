# Toronto Public Library Open Data

This document contains analysis of Toronto Public Library Open Data.

Toronto Public Library (TPL) Open Data is an important pice of the puzzle in terms of understanding the Digital Divide in the city of Toronto.
The City of Toronto does not collect or publish data on individual household level access to computers and the internet on a regular basis.  There are occasional surveys collecting this data and in the absence of direct indicators, proxy indicators such as computer access at libraries has become more important.  

TPL provides access points for many citizens and visitors to Toronto for computers and internet access.
Each TPL branch has computers connected with internet access that are available for use to library patrons during library hours.
Note that some branches allow patrons to access the internet though wifi during hours when the library is closed.
This has been a critical service for many citizens of Toronto during the Covid19 pandemic, when many services are available online rather than in person.
When data is available on wifi access before and during the Covid19 pandemic, it will be analyzed here.

Anecdotally, most computers are booked and are being used by library patrons for hours at a stretch.
Many of the users of TPL computers do not have access to their own computer desktop/laptop or appropriate internet access from their homes.
This is  an assumption since the city of Toronto does not collect or publish data on individual household level access to computers and the internet.
Since the city of Toronto does not collect or publish data on individual household level access to computers and the internet the usage of computers at each library branch is a **proxy** for demand for internet services, based on the assumption the majority of users are using free library internet services since they do not have these services at their residence.

As described by the TPL Planning Specialist, the term "logins" would be more appropriate than "users" for the data in this file:

"The short answer to this question is that they are logins and not unique users.
Our user sessions are tracked and reported in the Libraryâ€™s Reserve a Computer (RAC) management system.
One session equals use that is greater than 15 seconds. The duration of the session is the entire length of use within the booked time.
If the duration of the booked session is extended, it does not count as a new session.

Different RAC User Types tracked:

Guest: Sessions on 15 minute express computers.
They do not require a library card or a one-time slip to log in. The maximum length of a session is 15 minutes.

Internal: Sessions for User Education classes.
The length of a session can vary.

OneTime: Sessions where customers log in using a one-time use slip.
The maximum length of a session is 30 minutes.

Patron: Sessions where customers log in using a library card barcode. The length of a session can vary."
